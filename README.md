One of my first projects was to create a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors using html, css and javascript

original game repository: https://github.com/mdanialzadeh/rock-paper-scissors

since then I have continued my journey through front end development expanding my skills to include new frameworks and librarys such as Reacts and Recoil
which has opened up a whole new world of possiblities when working on projects. i had so much fun originally making this project and continuously think
back to how it could be expanded and refined. 

I decided that i would put my new experiance and skills to the test by remaking the projects on a larger scale including more details that i had previously
left out such as additional classes, stats for the character, multiple mobs, and even equipment and items that would aid in combat. i have also spent
time learning about design and wanted to refine the art and animations used. 

currently the game is still in the beggining phases with some functionality.

TODO: 
1. transitions between different screens such as character selection, travel, combat, random encounters, chests, etc
2. current enemies available: 1,  hoping to add 3-4 more enemy types with increasing level of dificulty as the character progresses and gets stronger.
3. add EXP bar and stats level up options 
4. skill variations with effects for each character
5. chests will contain equipments or potions that eaither heal or add stats
6. refine animations 
7. refine code to allow for expansion in the future
8. end game and progressive upgrades for replayability
9. ** have a sign in functionality allowing players to save their character and game progress on a server such as firebase to allow them to continue where they left off

this game is a personal project that i am working on in my free time but hope to create something i can share with friends while using the experience
to refine my skills in different applications of front end development using advance stratagies, oop, and states to have the game run.
